Developing-Data-Products
========================

This is my Repo for the final project of the coursera course *Developing Data Products* (part of the John Hopkins Data Science Spezialication): 

Here you find my shiny app for the project, namely:
- __ui.R__
- __server.R__

You can run it online on [shinyapps.io](https://rheinkind.shinyapps.io/SimpleInvesting/).

If you're looking for my __slidify__ presentation, you'll find it on [rpubs](http://rpubs.com/Dirk_Kalmbach/29070).
